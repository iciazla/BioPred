<p id="intro">
    This thesis presents an approach to personal biometric identification using a predictive modeling approach based on Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP)<br>
    and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with voice input. The study employs an existing voice dataset by (Alsaify et al., 2022) for training and testing <br>
    the proposed model in accurately predicting age, sex, height, and weight. The thesis presents an end-to-end approach that extracts features from voice signals<br>
    using PLP and utilizes CNNs for classification. The study investigates the performance of PLP-CNN models in comparison to MFCC-CNN, a traditional feature extraction<br>
    method and machine learning algorithm for voice recognition that merely uses mel frequency cepstral coefficients. The results demonstrate that the PLP-CNN approach<br>
    outperforms MFCC-CNN for biometric prediction based on voice. The model shows potential in various applications, such as criminology investigation, where biometric<br>
    identification is critical. Overall, this thesis contributes to the field of personal biometric identification and offers insights into the potential of PLP-CNN-based <br>
    approaches for improving the accuracy of voice-based identification systems.
